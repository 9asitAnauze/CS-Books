1. The special primary election shall be held not less than one hundred twenty nor more than one hundred thirty-three days after the occurrence of the vacancy, and the special general election shall be held not less than seventy nor more than eighty days after the special primary election.
 
5. Beginning fifteen days before the date of the election, the county recorder or other officer in charge of elections shall mail early ballots within forty-eight hours after receipt of a complete and correct early ballot request from persons qualified to vote.
 
C. For a vacancy in the office of United States senator, the governor shall appoint a person to fill the vacancy. That appointee shall be of the same political party as the person vacating the office and, except as provided in subsection D of this section, shall serve until the person elected at the next general election is qualified and assumes office. If the person vacating the office changed political party affiliation after taking office, the person who is appointed to fill the vacancy shall be of the same political party that the vacating officeholder was when the vacating officeholder was elected or appointed to that office.
 
D. If a vacancy in the office of United States senator occurs more than one hundred fifty days before the next regular primary election date, the person who is appointed pursuant to subsection C of this section shall continue to serve until the vacancy is filled at the next general election. If a vacancy in the office of United States senator occurs one hundred fifty days or less before the next regular primary election date, the person who is appointed shall serve until the vacancy is filled at the second regular general election held after the vacancy occurs, and the person elected shall fill the remaining unexpired term of the vacated office.

E. For a vacancy in the office of representative in Congress that occurs simultaneously with at least one hundred additional vacancies in the office of representative in Congress as prescribed by 2 United States Code section 8, a special general election to fill the vacancy in this state shall be held not more than forty-nine days after the declaration of the vacancy unless a regularly scheduled general election or previously scheduled special general election is held within seventy-five days after the declaration of the vacancy.
 
VACANCY identifies vacant housing units and reports the reason for the vacancy (e.g., for rent, for sale, used only seasonally). To be counted as "vacant," a unit has to be in livable condition and intended for residential use. For newly-constructed units, all exterior windows and doors must be installed, and usable floors must be in place. Dilapidated, condemned, and nonresidential buildings are thus excluded. Mobile homes and trailers (in 1970 and 1980) were counted only if they were intended for occupancy where they stood (i.e., they were not still in a factory or retailer's sales lot). Enumerators obtained vacancy information from landlords, owners, neighbors, or anyone else who might have known about the unit's status; in 1970, they could rely on personal inspection.
 
User Caution: By default, the extraction system rectangularizes the data: that is, it puts household information on the person records and does not retain the households as separate records. As a result, rectangular files will not contain vacant units, since there are no persons corresponding to these units. Researchers wishing to retain vacant units should instead choose a hierarchical file format when creating their extract.
 
This variable is essentially comparable across years. In every year, the form distinguished the following categories: "for rent," "for sale," "rented or sold but not yet occupied," and "other vacant." The degree to which the form distinguished among vacant units intended for occasional use, for seasonal use, and for migratory workers differed across years.

ACS editing procedure: 
The ACS editing procedure for VACANCY uses a variable about the record type that is not published. If a unit that has a record type that indicates it is "vacant regular housing" but has a value for VACANCY that is blank, don't know, refused, or a bad value, the value of VACANCY will be allocated. If this unit has a valid value for RENT, VACANCY will be replaced with "For rent." If it doesn't have a valid value for RENT, but it does have a valid value for property value (VALUEH), VACANCY will be replaced with "For sale only." If the unit has neither a valid value for RENT or for VALUEH, VACANCY will be allocated from another vacant unit without a second residence in the same geographic hierarchy. When this happens, the flag will show that the value is allocated (QVACANCY). 
If a unit that has a record type that indicates it is "vacant temporarily occupied housing units" but has a value for VACANCY that is blank, don't know, refused, or a bad value, the value of VACANCY will be replaced with "Seasonal/recreational/occasional use." When this happens, the flag will show that the value is allocated (QVACANCY).
If a unit that has a record type that indicates it is occupied, but has a value for VACANCY, it will be replaced with "Not in universe."

Property owners whose buildings are subject to ETPA will receive a cover letter, survey, and property owner/manager Affidavit from the City. The survey should be filled out and the property owner/manager Affidavit should be notarized.
 
If the City is unable to obtain a response, it will assume that no vacancies exist for the building. The City may attempt to obtain information and/or verify survey responses by other methods, such as review of public documents of record and request for site visit.
 
No. Prior to any vote to implement ETPA, the City must complete the Study to determine if the vacancy rate is lower than five (5) percent. The results of the Study will determine if City Council is then able to vote to implement ETPA.
 
Yes. Approximately forty (40) municipalities in New York State have completed rental vacancy studies, found a vacancy rate below five (5), and enabled ETPA through their local legislative body. The vast majority of these municipalities are located in Nassau, Westchester, and Rockland Counties. Within the Mid-Hudson Valley, the City of Kingston completed a rental vacancy study and enabled ETPA in 2022.
 
If further clarification is needed regarding the survey questions or for general information about the study, contact the City Planner, Jonathan Midler, at (845) 569-7381 or via email at jmidler@cityofnewburgh-ny.gov.
 
The Teacher Vacancy Grant is part of a pilot program aimed at addressing chronic shortages by providing the state's most understaffed districts with resources to attract, hire, support, and retain teachers. The grant allows districts maximum flexibility to use allocated funds in innovative, creative, and evidenced-based ways, such as signing bonuses, housing stipends, down-payment assistance, or loan repayments; to pay tuition and fees or provide residencies or apprenticeships; and to sustain employment of current teachers by providing materials, supplies, coaching, and school culture supports.
 
Districts in Evidence-Based Funding Tiers 1, 2, 3 (as calculated for fiscal year 2023) have been identified for eligibility. Districts in Tier 4 are ineligible for this program as are the 352 districts that reported having no unfilled teaching positions at the beginning of the 2022-23 school year. One hundred seventy districts have been identified as eligible to receive awards based on the highest counts of unfilled teaching (not administrative or school support) positions and to ensure that 60% (102) of awards go to rural districts and 40% (68) of awards go to urban districts. The 60/40 split is aligned to the composition of all Tier 1, 2, and 3 districts in the state. National Center for Education Statistics locale classifications were used to determine which districts were rural and which were urban.
 
This Community of Practice serves as a collaborative platform where passionate educators like yourself can come together to share insights, strategies, and lessons learned from your experiences implementing the Teacher Vacancy Grant. By joining forces, we aim to cultivate a supportive environment where innovative ideas flourish and where we collectively address challenges faced in tackling teacher vacancies.
 
Districts will be required to explain the causes of the teacher staffing challenges in the district, submit a detailed budget to ISBE outlining the planned use of funds to address those staffing challenges, agree to grant-specific terms, and share how the programming will be sustained beyond the term of the grant.
 
Districts can use the money to meet local needs and challenges pertaining to teacher recruitment and retention. Districts have flexibility over how they spend the funds, but ISBE will issue guidance to support districts with evidence-based ideas, such as:
